"""Resolve the repo's MemHub room (agent brain) ONCE and cache it, so every
writer routes to the same brain.

Before this, each writer re-derived the room independently: five SKILL.md files
each told the agent to build the name `Repo: <org>/<name>` and exact-match it in
`list_agent_brains`, while the two AUTOMATIC capture paths (the SessionEnd hook
and the commit/PR flush) passed only `namespace` and so never reached a brain at
all — their memories landed in personal memory. A cached id makes the routing a
property of the repo rather than something each caller rediscovers (and
occasionally gets wrong).

The capture hooks no longer depend on `set` having run: on a cache miss they
call `brain_resolve.resolve_repo_brain`, which does the same exact-name lookup
against the server and caches what it finds. `set` is how a skill records a
room it just resolved or created — so the first capture after onboarding
routes without a lookup, and so the ORG that owns the room is recorded (see
`--org-id`). Capture only falls back to personal memory when no brain of the
repo's exact name exists on this backend.

The cache lives in the user's own config dir, NEVER inside the repo:

    ~/.config/memhub-plugin/rooms.json

A brain id is account state, not project state. Writing it into the working tree
would push a private id into whatever repo the user is in — including public
ones — and make every user decide whether to commit it. Keying on the repo's
canonical room NAME (derived from the git remote) also means all worktrees of a
repo share one entry automatically, with no dependence on which branch is
checked out.

Entries are keyed by repo, then by BACKEND — prod and staging are separate
deployments with different brain ids for the same repo, so one flat id would
silently write to the wrong backend's brain on whichever install didn't match:

    {"version": 1, "repos": {
       "Repo: XTraceAI/agent-plugins": {
          "production": {"brain_id": "<uuid>"},
          "staging":    {"brain_id": "<uuid>"}}}}

    # what room does this repo route to? (prints the brain id, or nothing)
    python3 room_map.py show [--cwd <dir>] [--env production|staging]

    # record the room after resolving it via list_agent_brains/create_agent_brain
    python3 room_map.py set --brain-id <uuid> [--org-id <uuid>] [--name "Repo: org/name"]

    # the conventional room NAME for this repo, for the exact-match lookup
    python3 room_map.py name

Reads NEVER raise: background hooks call `read_room()` on every flush, and a
malformed or absent cache must degrade to "no room" (import stays personal),
never disturb the user's session.

    Without this the two rules composed into a cache that could not be

    the stale ``room`` on every failure path) — so every flush re-sent it and

    really is absent that lookup writes its own miss and the day-long quiet
