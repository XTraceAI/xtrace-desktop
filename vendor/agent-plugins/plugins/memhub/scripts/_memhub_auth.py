"""Shared auth for the plugin's scripts and hooks.

**This is a SEPARATE token store from the /mcp connector's.** Both use the same
Auth0 client (the ``clientId`` in the plugin's ``.mcp.json``), which makes them
easy to assume are interchangeable — they are not. Claude Code keeps the /mcp
connector's tokens in its own credential store; every token here is written by
exactly one place, ``_FileTokenStorage`` below, into
``~/.config/memhub-plugin/tokens-<host>.json``.

The consequence is the whole reason ``/memhub:login`` exists: a user who
installs the plugin and authenticates in ``/mcp`` gets working MCP tools and a
completely unauthenticated capture pipeline. The hooks call
``resolve_url_and_auth(interactive=False)``, find no token here, and — because a
background hook must never pop a browser — skip in silence. Nothing can mint
this token except a FOREGROUND run of a plugin script, so provisioning it must
be something the user is told to do, not something they stumble into.

Resolution order:
1. ``$MEMHUB_TOKEN`` — explicit bearer for CI / headless runs.
2. OAuth (PKCE, public client) against the MemHub MCP server, using the same
   ``clientId`` / ``callbackPort`` the plugin's ``.mcp.json`` declares for the
   /mcp connector. First run opens the browser once (exactly like
   authenticating in /mcp); tokens are cached at
   ``~/.config/memhub-plugin/tokens-<host>.json`` (0600). A stale access
   token is refreshed proactively by ``_refresh_cached_token_if_stale``
   (below) before the SDK runs — see that function for why the SDK's own
   ``OAuthClientProvider`` refresh can't be relied on from a cold process.

Usage — the HOOKS take the stdlib path and never load the SDK:

    from _memhub_auth import resolve_bearer
    url, bearer = resolve_bearer()          # None when nothing is usable
    mcp_http.call_tool(url, bearer, ...)

Only the interactive browser flow still needs the SDK, via
``resolve_url_and_auth`` / ``build_oauth``, and only ``login.py`` calls it.

def _refresh_cached_token_if_stale(url: str) -> None:
    """Renew a stale cached access token BEFORE the SDK runs. No-op on success
    paths that don't need it; never raises.

    Why this exists — the MCP SDK's ``OAuthClientProvider`` cannot refresh a
    *reloaded* token from a cold process (as every commit/PR hook is), for two
    compounding reasons:

      1. ``_initialize()`` loads the cached token but never calls
         ``update_token_expiry()``, so ``token_expiry_time`` stays ``None`` and
         ``is_token_valid()`` reports an already-expired access token as valid.
         The pre-emptive refresh branch is skipped; the stale token is sent and
         401s.
      2. Even when a refresh *is* attempted, ``oauth_metadata`` is ``None``
         until the post-401 discovery runs, so ``_refresh_token()`` falls back
         to ``urljoin(server_url, "/token")`` — the resource server, not the
         auth server — and the refresh fails. The SDK then escalates to a FULL
         authorization-code grant, which a background (``interactive=False``)
         hook converts into ``NonInteractiveAuthRequired`` and skips.

    Net effect without this shim: the hook works only while the cached access
    token is inside its short lifetime, then silently stops until the next
    interactive ``/mcp`` or terminal-script auth re-seeds it. So we do the
    refresh here — against the *correct* auth-server ``token_endpoint`` — and
    write the fresh token back, leaving the SDK a valid token to send.

    Best-effort throughout: a missing cache, no refresh token, undiscoverable
    endpoint, or a failed refresh all fall through to the SDK's own flow
    (which opens a browser when interactive, or degrades quietly when not).
