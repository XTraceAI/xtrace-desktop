"""PreToolUse hook — recall situated directives for the in-flight tool call.

Fires before Edit / Write / Bash. Reads the hook JSON (``tool_name`` +
``tool_input``), asks MemHub's ``recall_directives`` tool which lessons /
procedures fire on the concrete identifiers in that call (file paths, commands,
symbols), and injects any hits back as ``additionalContext`` so the agent sees
them BEFORE it acts. This is the serving half of procedural memory — fire on the
symbols you're touching mid-task, not on the opening prompt.

**Server funnel + fail-open.** The server runs the full v4 precision funnel
(symbol tripwire → contextual match semantics → LLM relevance gate, fail-open
past its 0.8s budget). The whole hook is best-effort: on a slow call, an auth
gap, or any error we emit nothing and exit 0 — a memory lookup must NEVER block
or break the agent's tool call. A tight internal timeout bounds the wait; the
hooks.json ``timeout`` is the hard backstop.

**Session already_fired.** A directive injects at most once per session: the
ids of directives actually INJECTED (not merely recalled — a gate-dropped
candidate keeps its chance at its real moment) persist in a per-session state
file and are (a) deduped client-side, which works against any server version,
and (b) sent to the server so its funnel can spend the budget on fresh
candidates. Repeats measured as 76% of all injection noise.

**Repo scope.** The repo name (git remote basename, else cwd basename) is sent
as ``repo``: the server scopes recall to directives learned there (legacy
unscoped rows still pass) and discounts the repo's own name as a trigger.

**Self-echo exclusion.** The Claude Code ``session_id`` is sent so the server
can skip directives minted from this session's own conversation. A 90-site
transcript audit (2026-08-02) found replayed same-session lessons — delivered
minutes after the agent already applied them — were the dominant ignored-
injection class; excluding them is a server-side filter, this client just
supplies the id (with a legacy retry for servers predating the param).

**First-touch-once + ranked cap.** The proactive path recalls at most once per
identifying handle (file path / command string) per session — repeat touches
re-bought the same answer at ~2s a call with zero measured conversions — and
injects at most ``_MAX_DIRECTIVES`` survivors, ranked by match specificity,
each rendered with the concrete trigger that fired (``fired on: …``) so the
agent can validate applicability in one glance.

**Reactive (PostToolUse) recall on failure.** The same script serves a second
hook: when a tool call FAILS, the error text itself is the richest firing
signal — a traceback names the module, a codegen error names the schema path,
an npm failure names the underlying binary an alias hid. On PostToolUse input
(detected by ``tool_response``) the script fires only when the output looks
like a failure, sends its tail as ``output`` so the server can extract
identifiers from it, and widens the client precision gate's haystack with the
same text (a lesson anchored on the CAUSE must survive even when the command
line only shows an alias). Measured motivator: a captured dangling-``$ref``
lesson anchored on ``openapi-typescript`` never fired at the failure site
because the command said ``npm run gen:types``.

**Client-side precision gate.** ``_precision_filter`` re-imposes the concrete
trigger-in-handle contract before injection — transitional belt-and-braces for
servers predating the match-semantics funnel; fail-open.

Invoked as: ``uv run --with 'mcp<2' python directive_recall.py`` with the PreToolUse
hook JSON on stdin.
