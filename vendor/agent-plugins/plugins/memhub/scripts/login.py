"""Authenticate this plugin install to MemHub — the command behind /memhub:login.

**Why a dedicated command.** The plugin's hooks authenticate from a token cache
that only a FOREGROUND script can create (see ``_memhub_auth``: a background
hook must never open a browser, so it can only ever consume a token someone
else minted). Nothing else in the product provisions that token on purpose —
pointing a stuck user at ``/memhub:import-session`` instead conflates login
with a different operation that does real, unrequested work and can fail for
reasons having nothing to do with auth, which makes the one signal you're
trying to read — am I authenticated? — impossible to read cleanly.

**What it checks beyond "did the browser flow succeed".** A login that works
today and dies tomorrow is not a successful login. If the authorization server
issues no refresh token, the access token simply expires (24h here) and every
hook goes quiet until someone logs in again. So this reports renewal as a
first-class result, at the moment the token is minted, rather than leaving it
to be discovered a day later by its absence.

Usage (all optional):
    login.py             log in if needed, then verify and report
    login.py --status    report only; never opens a browser
    login.py --force     discard the cached token and re-run the browser flow

Which backend it targets follows the INSTALL: run from the ``memhub`` plugin it
authenticates production, from ``memhub-staging`` it authenticates staging.
They are different Auth0 tenants with separate caches, so logging into one says
nothing about the other.
