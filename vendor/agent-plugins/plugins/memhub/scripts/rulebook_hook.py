"""Rulebook hook — three delivery lanes for team engineering rules.

Lanes (the mode argument):
  session  SessionStart: posture rules (on="session") in full, everything else
           as ONE compact index line. Session start is the weakest attention
           slot (measured 4% vs 88% for in-flight), so it carries worldview,
           never enforcement.
  pre      PreToolUse: proactive advisories at the violation moment (on="bash",
           "edit", "read", "write_stdlib") and the ordering-rule GATE (on="ordering").
           A read rule sees the Read tool AND the shell forms that pull a file
           into context (cat/head/tail/less/more/sed -n on a path).
  post     PostToolUse: reactive advisories on failing/erroring results
           (on="result"); ordering-rule ARM (edit-family) and RECEIPT (bash).
  fetch    Refresh the server book for one repo (GET /rules?view=hook with
           If-None-Match) into <BASE>/book/<repo>.json. The session lane spawns
           it DETACHED so SessionStart never waits on the network.
  flush    Stop / SessionEnd: POST unsent ledger rows to /fires in batches,
           behind a sent-watermark (ledger/.sent). `flush final` ignores the
           every-N-fires / every-M-minutes throttle.

Book = the server book, cached with its ETag. SessionStart re-fetches a stale
one BEFORE the digest renders (a fresh one just spawns the detached child), and
the pre lane refreshes it in the background once it is a minute old.
Offline → the cached book; no cache → no rules. There is no local rule file:
rules are authored through the memhub `create_rule` tool.

One book, several rulebooks. A rulebook is a container with its own membership
(container spec §3, §4), and one person can be bound by more than one — an
org-wide book plus their team's. The fetched book is the union of the rules
that bind them, and each rule carries `rulebook_id` and a `rulebook` block
with the book's `name`, `scope` and `member_count`. The server computes no
precedence and stores no conflict edges (D14): it ships those facts and the
hook decides. Here, "wider wins" is an ORDERING and never a suppression —
`book_rank` puts org-wide rules ahead of a three-person book's so that the
per-call MAX_ADVISE cap and the session-start posture budget spend on the
policy that binds the most people first. A rule cut by a cap is logged
`mode="suppressed"`, exactly as before. A backend that predates the container
change sends no book facts at all; every rule then ranks alike, both sorts are
stable, and this build behaves as it did — which is what lets one plugin serve
a migrated and an unmigrated backend.

How a fire reaches people (spec §5.3):
  * Every fire is DISCLOSED, on both channels, in one shape:
    `📏 Rule fired: <the rule, in 20 words or fewer>` — `⛔️` when a gate
    actually stopped the call. The USER sees it as the first line of the
    `systemMessage` stanza, above the detail line this hook has always shown
    (`XTrace ▸ …`); the AGENT is told, in `additionalContext`, to echo the
    byte-identical line at the top of its reply. Both are needed: the first is
    deterministic but invisible to everything downstream, and the second is the
    only copy that reaches the transcript session capture, a handoff or a PR
    comment can read. One function (`disclosure_line`) builds both, because a
    terminal showing one string while the agent says another would be worse
    than either channel alone.
  * The agent also gets the rule text under an XTrace Rulebook header, as
    before. Without the `systemMessage` a fire is invisible to the person the
    rule was written for.
  * `mode: gate` rules BLOCK: a pre-hook call matching a gate rule is denied
    (`permissionDecision: deny`) with the statement and the override its lane
    accepts. A Bash call takes `RULEBOOK_OVERRIDE='<why>' <command>`, which
    allows exactly that call; an edit takes a `rulebook-override[<rule>]: <why>`
    marker in the content, which allows that write and stays in the diff. The
    edit marker must name its rule BECAUSE it stays: an unnamed one would mean
    a different thing the day a second edit gate covers that line, and it is
    the form that content copied from elsewhere satisfies by accident. A Read
    tool call has neither a prefix nor content, so a blocked read is retried
    narrower (`offset`/`limit`), delegated to a subagent, or — when the whole
    file must enter THIS context — run as `RULEBOOK_OVERRIDE='<why>' cat
    <path>`, which is the Bash lane's override and records like one. Either way the fire
    records its own `override_reason`, and the next matching call is gated
    again. Gates are never deduped and never cut by the advisory cap. All
    three lanes gate because the hook sees them BEFORE they run — an edit rule
    matches `tool_input`, the content the tool is about to write, and a read
    rule the path a call is about to pull in. A result
    rule runs after the fact and cannot gate, and neither can the synthetic
    lane that finds files a shell command already wrote.
  * A gate is honoured from whatever book is cached, however old. There is no
    timer that turns a gate off: a rule retired on the server disappears at
    the next successful fetch, and a running session refreshes its own book
    once it is a minute old (pre lane, detached, throttled). A stale gate costs
    one `RULEBOOK_OVERRIDE`; a gate that silently stops enforcing because the
    server was unreachable for a day is the failure a gate exists to prevent.

What leaves the machine, exactly:
  * fetch  — the repo name (the origin remote's basename, else the directory's),
             nothing else.
  * fires  — identifiers only: rule id, session, repo, branch, tool, timestamps.
             The matched `excerpt` is written to the LOCAL ledger and is
             stripped before the POST.
  * recall — the anchor lane, and the one exception: the server's relevance
             judge needs the call itself, so it gets the file path, or the
             command line (heredoc bodies dropped, credential shapes redacted,
             truncated to 400 chars). Redaction is a denylist, not a guarantee.
             `MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_RECALL=0` turns this lane off and keeps the rest.

Usage (wired in hooks.json): printf %s "$IN" | python3 rulebook_hook.py {session|pre|post}

State (book cache, ordering state, fire ledger) lives under
$MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_BASE, else ~/.config/memhub-plugin/rulebook. Stdlib only; every failure path exits 0 with no output — a
broken hook must never touch the tool call or the session.

Two engines, one evaluate():
  * matcher rules — `evaluate()` is a pure function of (rule, event), so it
    can be exercised in isolation by the tests.
  * ordering rules — "run X after the last edit, before Y": an obligation
    state machine keyed by (worktree_root, branch, rule), never by session,
    so receipts from subagents and sibling sessions in the same checkout count.

A matcher rule may also carry a `given` block — predicates the call must
satisfy AFTER its regex matched: `repo` facts (branch, what the branch has
changed against its base, a dirty tree), `user` facts (what the person
typed this session), `file` facts (how much a read would pull into context)
and `agent` facts (main agent or subagent). They are answered by `Probes`,
lazily and once per hook call, from read-only git, the local transcript and
the file the call names; a fact that cannot be established never satisfies a
predicate, so the rule stays silent. `given_ok()` is pure over a Probes and
the event's read facts, which is how the verifier feeds it fixtures.

def degradation(row, given=None, ordering=None):
    """Why this hook cannot honour `row` in full, or "" when it can.

    `given` and `ordering` are the rule's RAW blocks. Only the caller knows
    where they sit: a server row keeps `given` inside its `matcher`, a pilot
    row at the top level.

    A rule may be newer than the hook reading it, and until now that was
    silent in the worst direction: the engine reads an `ordering` block with
    `spec.get(...)`, so a key it does not know is ignored and the rule runs as
    if the condition were satisfied. Version 0.40.1 did exactly that with a
    `given` — five spurious overrides in one session, and nothing anywhere
    said the hook had not read the rule it was enforcing.

    A rule that says so itself (`min_hook_version`) and one that merely
    carries a key we do not know are the same fact, so they degrade the same
    way: the rule advises, never gates, and says once per session that this is
    what happened.

    SCOPE, stated plainly: this protects FORWARD skew — this hook reading a
    rule written for a later one. It cannot protect a hook OLDER than the
    field itself, because the check is code that only the newer hook has: 0.53
    loads a rule floored at 0.54 and its ordering engine ignores the condition
    it cannot read. Closing that needs the server to serve an advice-only
    representation to a hook below the floor, which is why `fetch_book` sends
    `hook_version`; the server half is not in this repo."""

          is the bypass that matters: naming your OWN branch, or any descendant
          of it, makes the diff measure zero and a 5,000-line branch reads as
          empty. A PR onto such a base would be empty too, so no honest call
          names one.

          staging` would probe the first and open the second. If a command
          cannot say plainly what it merges into, it does not get to choose.

    `status=active` became a 400), taking every book fetch down silently.
    Not sending the parameter is the one form no grammar change can break.

    `hook_version` rides along so the SERVER can enforce a rule's

    plainly: the check lives in code that exists only in the hook it is
    protecting against. A 0.53 hook does not know the field, loads the rule
    anyway, and its ordering engine ignores the condition it cannot read — the
    exact 0.40.1 shape. What the local check buys is FORWARD skew (this hook
    reading a rule written for a later one); the backstop for hooks already

    and it cannot do that without being told who is asking. An older hook

# ── what leaves the machine on the recall path ─────────────────────────────
#
# `/recall` is the one lane that sends content rather than identifiers: the
# server's relevance judge decides whether an anchor rule applies to THIS call,
# and it cannot do that from a rule id. So the command line goes with it.
#
# A command line is also where credentials live — `curl -H "Authorization:
# Bearer …"`, `psql postgres://user:pw@host`, `--token=…`. Those are worth
# nothing to the judge and must not reach a model, so they are replaced before
# the POST. `shell_only` has already dropped heredoc bodies by this point, so
# what remains is the shell line itself.
#
# This is a denylist and cannot be complete — the docstring and the README say
# so, and `MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_RECALL=0` turns the lane off entirely for anyone who
# would rather not send command text at all. It is a floor, not a guarantee.
_REDACTIONS = (
    # `--token=x`, `--password x`, `API_KEY=x` — the value, not the flag, so the
    # judge still sees that a credential was passed. A quoted value
    # (`--token='x'`, `PGPASSWORD="two words"`) goes whole, quotes and all.
    #
    # `auth` is deliberately NOT in this list even though it names plenty of
    # real secrets: it also names `gh auth login`, `--auth-mode`, `auth0_sub`,
    # and eating the word after those costs the judge the verb of the command
    # for nothing. The `Authorization:` header has its own rule below, which is
    # where `auth` actually carries a credential.
    # The key must END with the credential word. Allowing a trailing suffix
    # matched `--token-budget 500` and ate the number, which is not a secret and
    # is exactly the kind of over-redaction that degrades the judge on ordinary
    # commands. `aws_secret_access_key`, `--with-token` and `API_KEY` all still
