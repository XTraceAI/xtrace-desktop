"""The harness-tied memory sensor. FLAGGED OFF by default.

Nothing in this file runs unless `MEMHUB_HARNESS_EXTRACT` is on. With it on,
MemHub classifies each turn's moment and the coding agent that lived the turn
decides whether it holds a lesson:

  Stop(turn N)       `stop`     takes the turn's closed error arcs from the
                                rulebook hook and spawns a detached `extract`
                                child, which builds the redacted window, asks
                                the classifier, and on a signal records the
                                MOMENT (turn, kind, router hint, state stamp).
                                Then, if an earlier turn's moment is waiting,
                                it BLOCKS the stop: the agent that lived the
                                turn, its work for the person done and nothing
                                else competing, must decide whether the moment
                                holds a lesson — run the create-rule skill on
                                it, or say in one line why there is none.

Why a blocking Stop and not a line injected with the next prompt: that lane
reached the agent 19 times in five real sessions and produced 0 `create_rule`
calls. A line stapled to the person's live request lost to the request every
time, and "say nothing if there is no lesson" made ignoring it look exactly like
judging it. At Stop the agent is idle, and the one-line verdict makes the
outcome visible either way.

The block hands an EARLIER turn's moment: this turn's classifier is still
running in the child. A moment from a session's last turn is never handed.
The continuation's own Stop carries `stop_hook_active` and passes, so one
block is one continuation. Whatever the agent decides, a proposal lands
`proposed` and a person activates it: nothing here fires or activates a rule.

Files, under $MEMHUB_HARNESS_DIR (default ~/.config/memhub-plugin/harness),
all created private:

  <session>.moments.jsonl    flagged moments, then a `handed` row per block
                             (append-only: two lanes write it at once)
  <session>.meta.json        last extracted turn, repo, cwd, transcript cursor
  <session>.meta.json.lock   serializes the meta file's read-merge-write
  <session>.turn-*.claim     the turn an extract child already took
  stop.log / extract.log     one line per step, never prompt text

Every path fails open and silent: a broken sensor must never touch the tool
call or the session. Stdlib only.
