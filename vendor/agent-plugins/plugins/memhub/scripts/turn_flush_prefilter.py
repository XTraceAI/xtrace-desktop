"""Cheap gate for the per-turn Stop-hook flush (stdlib only).

The Stop hook fires after EVERY assistant turn, and the real flush costs a
``uv run --with mcp`` spawn — measured at ~0.8s warm, ~1.4s cold, before any
network. Paying that on turns with nothing to send, or while a previous flush
is still in flight, would burn a laptop's battery for no memory. This script
runs under the system python3 (~0.02s, no uv, no deps) and exits non-zero to
skip the expensive stage — the same two-stage shape the commit/PR flush hook
uses (``flush_prefilter.py``).

Skips when:

* ``MEMHUB_TURN_FLUSH`` is set to ``0`` / ``off`` / ``false`` — the opt-out,
* the flush already found this server cannot buffer per turn (dormant),
* the hook input has no usable ``session_id`` / ``transcript_path``,
* a flush for this session is already running (see below), or
* the transcript has not grown past the cursor — nothing new to ship.

**Fails OPEN.** Any unexpected error exits 0, so a bug here degrades to
"flush every turn" (correct, merely wasteful) rather than "never flush again"
(silent, total capture loss). The lock is re-acquired atomically by the flush
itself, so failing open cannot cause the overlap this gate exists to prevent.

Skipping is free: the cursor advances only after a flush SUCCEEDS, so whatever
this pass declines to send is simply carried by the next turn's flush.
