"""OpenAI Codex session reader: rollout transcripts → Claude Code records.

Moved from ``codex/codex_to_claude.py`` + the locate half of
``codex/import_codex_session.py`` (both remain as thin shims for one release).

Transforms an OpenAI Codex *rollout* transcript into the Claude Code record
shape that MemHub's ``import_conversation`` auto-detects as a coding-agent
transcript — the tool-aware **agentic** ingestion path (facts + episodes + the
session gist).

Why re-shape instead of adding a Codex detector server-side: the agentic path
keys off *structure* ("records with a nested ``message`` and tool-call /
tool-result blocks"), while ``source_platform`` records provenance. A faithful
client-side transform gets the full agentic extraction and the import still
stores the real ``codex`` platform.

Codex rollout envelope (one JSON object per line)::

    {"timestamp": ..., "type": <t>, "payload": {...}}

The conversation lives in the ``response_item`` stream (the OpenAI Responses
API items actually exchanged with the model — this is what carries tool I/O in
order). The parallel ``event_msg`` stream is ignored for CONTENT because it
duplicates text without tool-call structure, but its cumulative ``token_count``
snapshots are the rollout's authoritative usage source.

Mapping (order preserved — gpt-5.x emits a ``reasoning`` item *before* its
``function_call`` and the loop must keep that order)::

    response_item message role=user   -> user  text
    response_item message role=assistant -> assistant text block
    response_item reasoning           -> assistant thinking block (summary only;
                                         encrypted_content is opaque, dropped)
    response_item function_call       -> assistant tool_use block
    response_item custom_tool_call    -> assistant tool_use block (apply_patch …)
    response_item function_call_output-> user tool_result block
    response_item custom_tool_call_output -> user tool_result block
    event_msg token_count              -> usage on the latest assistant record
    (role=developer / system prompt injections are skipped as noise)
