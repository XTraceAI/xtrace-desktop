"""Check a candidate rule against the engine that will actually run it.

A rule can be well-formed, match the command you had in mind, and still be
wrong in ways nobody sees until it is live and nagging the whole team:

  * it fires on a command that merely MENTIONS the pattern (`grep "git push"`),
    which is the largest false-fire class we have measured;
  * it still fires after the author fixes the thing it asked for, so complying
    with the rule does not silence it;
  * its pattern is too long or backtracks, so the hook drops the WHOLE rule at
    load time — silently, on every teammate's machine.

So this runs the candidate through `rulebook_hook.to_hook_rule()`,
`evaluate()`, `given_ok()` and `OrderingEngine` — the same code the live hook
uses, never a re-implementation — against cases the author supplies. Exit 0 =
every case behaved; exit 1 = at least one did not, and the table says which.

  rulebook_verify.py --rule '<create_rule JSON>' \
      --fires 'gh pr merge 7' \
      --silent 'grep -rn "gh pr merge" docs/' \
      --silent 'ls -la'

  rulebook_verify.py --rule-file cand.json --cases cases.json

For an `edit` / `write` rule, a case is `path::content`:

  --fires '/repo/src/db.py::conn = connect(url, verify=False)' \
  --silent '/repo/src/db.py::conn = connect(url)'

A rule with a `given` block needs the facts it asks about. Give them once for
every case (`--branch`, `--diff-path`, `--diff-lines`, `--dirty`,
`--user-said`), or per case in a `--cases` file, where a case may be an
object: {"case": "git push", "branch": "main", "diff_paths": [...],
"diff_lines": 620, "dirty": true, "user_said": ["please push it"]}.
No git runs and no transcript is read — the fixture IS the repo.

For a `read` rule a case is the Read tool (`read:<path>`, narrowed with
`@<offset>,<limit>` or `@<limit>`) or a shell command run through the same
parser the hook uses (`bash:<command>`, relative paths against `--cwd`).
`--file-lines N` stands in for the file's length so a case needs no real
file; `--agent-main false` runs the case as a subagent:

  --fires  'read:/repo/src/service.py' --file-lines 900 \
  --silent 'read:/repo/src/service.py@1,200' \
  --silent 'bash:cat src/service.py | head -50' \
  --silent 'bash:cat src/service.py' --agent-main false

An `ordering` rule is verified as a SEQUENCE of steps joined by ` >> `, ending
in the gated call; the case fires when that call is gated:

  --fires  'edit:src/a.py >> gate:git push'
  --silent 'edit:src/a.py >> ok:pytest tests/ >> gate:git push'
  --fires  'edit:src/a.py >> red:pytest tests/ >> gate:git push'

Stdlib only; no network; no server concepts.
