"""Find the repo's agent brain on the server, once, and cache it.

``room_map`` routes every writer to one brain — but only once its cache holds an
id, and until now the only things that filled it were ``/memhub:onboard`` and
``/memhub:spec init``. So a user who never ran either had every automatic
capture land in personal memory even when their team's repo brain existed.

On a cache miss the capture path asks the server once, matches the repo's
canonical room name, and writes the id back. Every later flush is a local
lookup again.

**Resolve, never create.** A brain is team-visible — teammates see it appear and
it shapes where memory lands. A background hook firing after a turn is the wrong
place to make that decision on someone's behalf, so an absent brain stays absent
and capture continues to personal memory exactly as before. Creating one remains
an explicit ``/memhub:onboard``.

**Exact name match only.** The room name is ``Repo: <org>/<name>`` (see
``room_map.room_name``), derived from the git remote. Fuzzy matching here would
silently route a session into a brain that merely looked similar — worse than
not routing at all, because it is invisible and lands teammate-visible content
somewhere nobody expects.
