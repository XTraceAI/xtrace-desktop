"""Whole-transcript session flush — fired on commit/PR events and at SessionEnd.

Reads the Claude Code hook input JSON from stdin (``session_id``,
``transcript_path``) and sends the transcript-so-far to ``import_conversation``
with ``conversation_id = session_id``, so every trigger feeds one conversation
and one server-side watermark (``agentic_seen_uuids``): the full transcript is
re-sent, but only the DELTA since the last flush is processed. Commits/PRs are
semantic work boundaries, so flushing there makes memory available mid-session
(parallel sessions see fresh decisions), shapes batch episodes into work-unit
narratives, and gives the gist's fold-forward an outcome-flavored cadence.

**Also the SessionEnd hook.** It must stay a script rather than an
``agent``-type hook: headless ``claude -p`` runs reject agent-type Stop
hooks outright (``Agent stop hooks are not yet supported outside REPL``),
and an agent cannot reliably re-emit a transcript that can run to tens of
MB. Being a script also keeps it in step with the other capture paths:
sending ``org_id``, filtering slash-command wrappers, and deriving a title
all matter here exactly as much as they do there.

Deliberately INDEPENDENT of the per-turn hook rather than reusing its cursor.
This is the backstop for exactly the cases where per-turn capture is dormant —
disabled, unauthenticated, or failing — so inheriting its state would mean
inheriting whatever went wrong with it. Re-sending everything and letting the
server's watermark dedup is the property that makes it a second witness.

Discipline mirrors the per-turn hook: THIS SCRIPT NEVER FAILS LOUDLY —
any error exits 0 quietly (the hook is async fire-and-forget; memory capture
must never disturb the user's session).

Auth = the plugin's OWN token cache (shared `_memhub_auth`), which is a
different store from the /mcp connector's despite sharing an Auth0 client:
$MEMHUB_TOKEN if set (CI escape hatch), else the cached plugin OAuth token,
refreshed automatically. interactive=False — a background hook must never
pop a browser, so with no cached token it degrades quietly (run
/memhub:login once to seed the cache).
Endpoint: $MEMHUB_MCP_BASE_URL(+_SERVER_PATH) > the plugin's .mcp.json
mcpServers.*.url > a default derived from the plugin install path (prod for
`memhub`, staging for `memhub-staging`).
