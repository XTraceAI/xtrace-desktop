"""Records that must never leave the machine as conversation content.

Claude Code writes slash commands and their output into the transcript as
ordinary USER records — a real ``type: "user"`` carrying a real ``message`` —
so no type-based filter excludes them. Shipped as-is, ``/model`` and its "Set
model to Sonnet 5" reply are extracted as things the USER SAID.

Measured over 205 local sessions: **687 of 5,839 text-carrying user records,
11.8%**. (Against ALL user records it is only 1.8%, but that denominator is
dominated by tool results, which are also typed ``user`` and carry no prose —
the 11.8% is the share of what actually reads as conversation.)

Shared by both upload paths deliberately. ``flush_turn`` ships deltas per turn
and ``import_session`` ships whole transcripts; a filter on only one of them
would mean the same session is clean or dirty depending on which path captured
it, which is worse than either answer applied consistently.

Stdlib only, and no side effects on import — ``flush_turn`` runs inside a Stop
hook where an import-time failure would surface as a traceback in the user's
session.

# headroom for older clients that inlined more, and it sits far below the
# 3.5 MB upload slice and the server's 4 MiB request limit.
#
# Why this exists: an MCP ``search_memory`` reply of 5.26 MB (two HTML
# artifacts with screenshots inlined) was rejected by the client as too large
# — the model saw a 1.4 KB error — but the client stored the WHOLE reply in the
# record's ``mcpMeta``. One 5.27 MB transcript line can never fit a request the
# server accepts, and because the cursor rightly never advances past a failed
