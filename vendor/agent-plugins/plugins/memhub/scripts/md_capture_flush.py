"""Stop hook: save each markdown file this turn wrote as a DRAFT artifact.

Pairs with ``md_capture.py`` (the PostToolUse collector). That script records
paths; this one, at turn end, reads each file's FINAL on-disk state, applies
the capture rule (``.md``, >= size floor or frontmatter opt-in, not a veto
location), and ships it to ``save_artifact`` — routed to the repo's room the
same way ``save_artifact.py`` routes, so an auto-captured spec lands where a
hand-saved one would.

Two sources feed one pass. ``dirty`` holds what the Edit/Write collector saw.
The GIT SWEEP covers what it could not: a file written through the Bash tool
(heredoc, ``sed -i``, a python script) never fires that matcher, so every
repo the session recorded a ``cwd`` for is asked ``git status`` for
modified/untracked ``.md`` files. Only what is dirty in git NOW and newer
than the session's start stamp qualifies — a committed, clean file is never
swept, and neither is a file the human left in the worktree before the
session began. Ignored files, submodules, symlinks and anything resolving
outside the repo are skipped. Both sources go through the same veto, size,
hash and cap logic; a path in both is saved once.

Draft semantics: the server has no status column, so a capture is marked by
the ``auto-captured`` tag and a rationale naming the session. Re-saving the
same ``name`` versions it (server behaviour), so an agent or human publishing
the file later with ``save_artifact.py`` supersedes the draft in place rather
than sitting beside it — the failure the artifact-sync reminder exists for.
A file already linked in the repo's ``.claude/artifact-map.json`` (by its
``path``) is SKIPPED outright: that lineage is hand-saved via ``/memhub:spec``
under its own name, and a draft named from the H1 would open a second one.

Name = frontmatter ``title:`` > first ``# H1`` > filename stem. The agent keeps
titles stable across rewrites (the Artifact tool asks it to), so the name is
a usable version key. Type = frontmatter ``type:`` > ``spec`` when the name or
path says so > ``document``.

Runs via ``uv run --with 'mcp<2'`` (needs the SDK), fire-and-forget from the
Stop hook. NEVER FAILS LOUDLY: any error exits 0 quietly — memory capture must
not disturb the session. A path leaves the retry list only when it was saved
(content hash recorded), judged a non-candidate, or is unchanged since its
last save — so a server blip or the per-turn cap costs one turn, and a flaky
server never re-saves an unchanged file. A path that exhausted its retries
is remembered by content hash (``gaveup``): the sweep would otherwise offer
it again on every Stop for as long as it stays modified in git, so it is
retried only once its content changes.
