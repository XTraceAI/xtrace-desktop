"""Flag candidate rules that collide with rules already in the book — BEFORE
they are filed. Deterministic, offline-capable, stdlib only.

Why this lives in the skill and not on the server: the server's re-import
identity is (rulebook, source_ref path, title) and it deliberately never
adopts a rule owned by another document — so a candidate whose title or
matcher collides with an existing rule is filed as a second draft, silently.
The agent running `/memhub:create-rule` or `/memhub:rules-from-sessions` is the
right place to notice: it is already holding the candidates and the book, and
it can read two statements and say "same rule" better than any key can.

Two inputs, three checks:

  --candidates <file|->   the create_rule bodies you are about to send
  --existing   <file>     the `list_rules` reply (include_retired=True, all
                          pages concatenated; no engine blocks) — title
                          collisions across every rulebook you can see, so
                          pass it WITHOUT a rulebook_id
  --repo <name>           the hook view of the ACTIVE book (engine blocks),
                          fetched from the server, or --book <file> to read a
                          cached / test book instead — matcher + anchor
                          collisions against what can actually double-fire
  --rulebook-id <id>      the book the candidates will be filed into

A rulebook is a container with its own membership, and one person can be bound
by several (container spec §3, §4) — so both inputs span more than one book and
a candidate can collide with a rule it will never share a book with. Every hit
names its book. A hit outside `--rulebook-id` is marked `cross_book`, because
`supersedes_rule_id` retires a rule WITHIN one book and cannot reach it: those
two rules will both fire on the same call until a human retires one side.

  same_title      normalised title equal (case / punctuation insensitive)
  same_matcher    same event and the same primary pattern (command_rx /
                  path_rx / content_rx / required_command_rx), whitespace-
                  normalised — two actives here fire on the same call
  anchors_overlap the anchor sets intersect (case-insensitive); the
                  intersection is listed so a one-symbol overlap is judged,
                  not auto-flagged

Output: JSON on stdout — per candidate its hits, and the existing rules with
NO deterministic hit (title + statement) so the semantic pass has one list
to read. A human-readable summary goes to stderr. Exit 0 always; a fetch
failure degrades to "active book unavailable" and says so.

Usage:
  rulebook_conflicts.py --candidates cands.json --existing rules.json --repo xmem
  rulebook_conflicts.py --candidates - --book ~/.config/memhub-plugin/rulebook/book/xmem-*.json
