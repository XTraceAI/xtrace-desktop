"""Per-turn session flush — fired by the Stop hook after every assistant turn.

Ships only the transcript BYTES WRITTEN SINCE THE LAST SUCCESSFUL FLUSH, using
``flush="auto"`` so the server stores each turn durably on arrival but extracts
only once the accumulated span is batch-sized. Extracting per turn would hand
the batch extractor a 2-5 event fragment and shred the episode boundaries it
derives; buffering server-side keeps episodes whole while making each turn
durable the moment it happens.

**Why a byte cursor and not "re-send the transcript".** Re-sending the whole
file every turn needs no client state, and the server's uuid watermark makes it
correct — but it re-uploads the entire session on each turn, so total upload
grows with the SQUARE of the session length. On a long coding session that is
gigabytes to say what a few kilobytes would. So the client sends its delta and
the server holds what it has not yet extracted.

**The cursor advances only on success.** Every uncertainty resolves toward
re-sending: no cursor, a shrunken file, a failed call, an ambiguous response.
The server dedups incoming records against (extracted ∪ buffered), so
over-sending costs bandwidth while under-sending leaves a gap nothing will ever
notice. That asymmetry is the whole reason this file is written the way it is.

**One flush per session at a time.** The server expects a session's turns to
arrive in order, so an advisory ``flock`` keeps two hooks from overlapping when
one turn finishes before the previous flush has returned. Losing that race is
not an error: the cursor did not move, so the next turn's flush carries both.

Discipline mirrors the other capture hooks: THIS SCRIPT NEVER FAILS LOUDLY.
Any error exits 0 quietly — memory capture must never disturb the session.

Auth = the plugin's OWN token cache (shared ``_memhub_auth``) — a different
store from the /mcp connector's, so being connected in /mcp does NOT mean this
hook can authenticate. Non-interactive: a per-turn background hook must never
pop a browser, so it can only consume a token ``/memhub:login`` already minted.
