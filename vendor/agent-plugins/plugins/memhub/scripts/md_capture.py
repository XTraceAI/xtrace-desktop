"""PostToolUse(Edit|MultiEdit|Write) collector for markdown artifact capture.

Records which ``.md`` files this session wrote so the Stop hook
(``md_capture_flush.py``) can save each one ONCE per turn as a draft artifact.
Nothing leaves the machine from here — this script only appends a path to a
per-session state file and exits. It runs under the system ``python3``
(stdlib only, 3.9 on macOS) on every edit, so it has to be cheap and it must
never block or fail the edit: every error path exits 0 with no output.

Why capture at all: specs and reports an agent writes are the session's
deliverables, and the transcript extractor routinely produces zero artifacts
from a session that wrote three of them (measured 2026-08-20). Why only
``.md``: a five-day backtest over 31 sessions found 67 distinct ``.md``
writes, of which 7 were real documents — and those 7 were the only ones over
~10 KB outside Claude's own memory and scratch directories. So the rule is
deliberately dumb: markdown, past a size floor, not in a veto location. A
file may opt in below the floor with ``memhub: artifact`` in its YAML
frontmatter. Customers' directory layouts are not consulted — ``docs/`` is
our convention, not theirs.

Why two stages: the edit hook sees one write; the deliverable is the file's
state when the agent STOPS. A spec edited nine times in a turn is one
artifact, not nine. The flush reads the file off disk at Stop.

Why a Bash mode too: a harness that prefers shell edits (heredocs, ``sed -i``,
a python one-liner) never fires the Edit/Write matcher, so a spec written that
way never entered ``dirty`` and was never flushed — three MemHub-Backend specs
went uncaptured that way on 2026-09-07. Parsing the command string for
redirects is a losing game. Instead the Bash matcher records only the
session's ``cwd`` (plus a session-start stamp, once), and the flush sweeps
``git status`` in that repo for modified/untracked ``.md`` files: the
deliverable is on disk either way, and git already knows which files are new.
