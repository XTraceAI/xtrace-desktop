"""Personal access key (``mhk_…``) lifecycle for the plugin (stdlib only).

**Why the plugin mints one at all.** Every hook here runs as a cold background
process that must never open a browser, so it can only ever consume a
credential something else provisioned. OAuth gives one that expires in ~24h and
needs a refresh dance the MCP SDK cannot perform from a cold start. A personal
access key has no such cycle: it is a static bearer, valid until it expires on
a schedule we choose or is revoked.

The trick is that minting one needs no separate credential. The access token
the browser flow already produces is accepted by ``/v1/developer/access-tokens``
(verified against staging), so ``/memhub:login`` can log in once and hand the
hooks something durable — no curl, no pasting, and no waiting on a Settings
page to ship.

**Deliberately stdlib-only.** The whole point of a static bearer is that using
it needs no SDK, so this module must not drag one in: it is imported by the
health check, which runs before the user's first prompt under a bare python3.
Measured, ``uv run --with 'mcp<2'`` costs ~1.1s against ~0.07s here.

**One key per machine, by label.** The secret is returned exactly once, so a
key we did not store is unrecoverable — and the account holds at most five.
Minting per login would exhaust that in a week. Instead each machine claims a
stable label and reuses its stored secret; a same-label key we have no secret
for is an orphan from a lost cache, and is revoked before minting its
replacement so the cap counts real credentials rather than debris.

    * ``mktime`` on a ``%z``-parsed struct read a UTC time as LOCAL and

    A rejected timestamp is not loud: it returns None, which every caller reads
    as "no known expiry" and therefore as healthy — a key that never appears to
    lapse. So the parser has to accept what it is actually given: ``Z``,
    ``+HH:MM``, ``+HHMM``, fractional seconds, or no zone at all.
