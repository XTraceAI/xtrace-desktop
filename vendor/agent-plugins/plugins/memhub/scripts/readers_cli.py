# --- exact session detail ---------------------------------------------------
#
# An opt-in mode for a consumer that needs one identified session's own text
# rather than an index of it. It differs from the ordinary export in exactly
# two ways, and both are the point: no part of a source is copied to disk, and
# every quantity the read can spend is declared here and checked before it is
# spent. Discovery, identity, ambiguity and revision baselines are the same
# code the ordinary export runs, and the records come out of the same
# converters -- this mode adds a way to feed them, not a second normalizer.

# Two budgets, because a read does two different kinds of work. Identifying
# candidates means reading a small header from every rollout discovery found,
# almost all of them other sessions; acquiring the selected session means
# holding its whole body. Charging the first against the second made one
# large unrelated history refuse a tiny selected session as though *it* were
# too large, so each has its own ceilings and its own honest reason.
#
# Body: the most source bytes one exact-detail read may hold, across the files
# it actually acquires -- the rollouts of the selected paginated group, a
# Cursor transcript, and the saved pin that chose it. Reserved before any of
