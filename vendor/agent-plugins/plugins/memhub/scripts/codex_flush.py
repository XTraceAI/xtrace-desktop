"""Codex capture: hook-triggered flush of a Codex session into MemHub.

The Codex sibling of ``cursor_flush.py``, one seam simpler: rollouts are
append-only JSONL, so "anything new?" is a byte-size comparison rather than a
blob-set. Everything downstream is the shared machinery (``readers.codex``
transform, ``redact``, ``resolve_bearer``, ``brain_resolve``, ``room_map``,
``mcp_http`` — bare python3, no mcp SDK).

Codex clones Claude's hook contract (same ``hooks.json`` shape, same
``${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}``), so the payload is EXPECTED Claude-shaped —
``session_id`` / ``transcript_path`` — but this script trusts nothing it
hasn't verified live: identity is taken from whichever of those fields is
present (the rollout filename carries the uuid), and a payload with neither
logs and exits rather than guessing ``latest`` (importing the wrong session
would fold-forward the wrong conversation's gist).

Every event flushes with server mode "now" — same reason as cursor_flush:
staging showed "auto"-buffered records being dedup-registered without
persisting, and Codex has no SessionEnd hook to guarantee a later drain.
Revert to boundary-only "now" when the backend folds dedup registration
into the drain.

Events wired (see hooks/codex-hooks.json, generated): ``Stop`` = turn
boundary, always flush on growth; ``PostToolUse`` = milestone commands only
(git commit / gh pr), so ordinary tool traffic stays quiet.
