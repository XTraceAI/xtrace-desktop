"""Publish a file so no reader ever sees it half-written (stdlib only).

**Why this is one function and not three copies.** Every durable thing this
plugin keeps — the OAuth token cache, the access key, the per-session capture
cursor — is written by more than one process: the per-turn flush, the SessionEnd
backstop (which does not take the per-turn flock), and the PreToolUse directive
check that fires on every file edit. All three needed the same care, so all
three grew their own copy of it, and the copies drifted: a review round found
the same non-atomic write in one file, and the same bug was sitting in the other
two under slightly different spellings.

The failure this prevents is silent in the worst way. A reader that catches a
truncated token cache does not raise — it concludes there is no usable
credential and skips, which is indistinguishable from "not logged in". A
truncated cursor file is a corrupt cursor.

Two properties, and both matter:

* **the temp name is per process.** A shared ``<name>.tmp`` is not atomic under
  concurrency at all: two writers open it with ``O_TRUNC``, interleave, and one
  renames a spliced document — or fails outright because the other's rename
  removed the file underneath it. Renaming a private temp means each writer
  publishes something it wrote whole, and losing the race just means being
  overwritten by an equally valid document.
* **the mode is set at creation**, not chmod'd afterwards. Writing first leaves
  a secret at the process umask — 0644 on a default setup — for a window that
  costs nothing to close.

    POSIX rename is atomic and never refuses because another process is

    FILE_SHARE_DELETE — a reader between open and close, another writer's

    Measured on a real Windows 11 host under the concurrency self-test
    (12 processes in a read-modify-write storm on one file), a single
    publish can stay refused for ~0.7s — as thousands of sub-millisecond
    collisions, not one long hold. That shape dictates the strategy: flat
    millisecond retries with jitter, under a time budget far above anything
    measured. A geometric backoff loses exactly here — it samples the gaps
    a handful of times and spends the rest of its budget asleep. A
    persistent denial (an ACL, a file something genuinely holds) still
    raises once the budget runs out.
