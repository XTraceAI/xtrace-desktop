"""Import a specific coding-agent session into MemHub — a terminal operation.

The transcript is read off disk and shipped straight to the
`import_conversation` MCP tool: the model never re-emits the content, so a
session of ANY size works.

Mirrors the SessionEnd hook's contract exactly:
- raw transcript records passed AS-IS (the tool auto-detects the Claude Code
  shape and runs agentic, tool-aware extraction)
- `conversation_id` = the session id (file stem) by default, so re-imports of
  the same session are INCREMENTAL: the server-side watermark admits only
  records it hasn't seen, and the session gist folds forward instead of
  duplicating.

Auth = the SAME OAuth the /mcp connector uses (shared `_memhub_auth`):
$MEMHUB_TOKEN if set (CI escape hatch), else the cached plugin OAuth token,
else a one-time browser approval. No memhub-cli required.

Usage (mcp SDK pulled ephemerally by uv):
    uv run --with 'mcp<2' python import_session.py --session <session-id-or-path>
        [--conversation-id <id>] [--source-platform claude|codex|cursor]
        [--title "..."] [--url <mcp-url>]

`--session` accepts either a path to a .jsonl transcript or a bare session id,
which is resolved by searching ~/.claude/projects/*/<id>.jsonl.
