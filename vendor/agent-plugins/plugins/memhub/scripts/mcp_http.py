"""Minimal MCP client over streamable HTTP — stdlib only.

**Why this exists.** The hooks loaded the MCP Python SDK, and paid for it on
every invocation: measured 1.09s warm for `uv run --with 'mcp<2' python -c
"import mcp"` against 0.07s for a bare python3. Three of the hooks that paid it
are SYNCHRONOUS — the PreToolUse directive check has no prefilter, so every
single file edit waited on interpreter start and dependency resolution before
the hook had made a single network call.

The SDK was there almost entirely for OAuth: `OAuthClientProvider` does PKCE,
token storage and refresh, which is the genuinely hard part. Once the plugin
mints a personal access key, authentication is one static header and that whole
reason evaporates. What remains is the transport, and the transport turns out
to be small.

**Verified against the live server, not assumed:**

* no session is negotiated — the server returns no ``Mcp-Session-Id`` and does
  not want one back;
* ``initialize`` is NOT required. A fresh process can call a tool directly and
  get a result, so this does ONE round trip where the SDK does three
  (initialize → notifications/initialized → the call);
* replies come back as SSE frames (``event: message`` / ``data: {json}``) even
  for a plain request/response call, so both framings are handled.

**Static bearer only, by design.** Anything needing an interactive browser flow
still belongs to the SDK, in ``login.py``. This is the path a background hook
takes, and a background hook can only ever consume a credential someone else
provisioned.

Results mimic the SDK's shape — ``.content[].text``, ``.structuredContent``,
``.isError`` — so call sites keep their existing response handling and this
change stays a transport swap rather than a rewrite of every caller.
