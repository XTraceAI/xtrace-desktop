"""What to call a captured session.

Claude Code names a session by writing its own generated title into the
transcript as an ``ai-title`` record, and the capture paths simply forward it.
That works for an interactive session and for nothing else:

* **Headless runs never get one.** A session started through the SDK or
  ``claude -p`` (``entrypoint: "sdk-cli"``) emits no ``ai-title`` at all —
  title generation is a UI feature. Measured locally: 168 of 178 ``cli``
  sessions carry one, **0 of 2 ``sdk-cli`` and 0 of 5 ``claude-desktop``
  ones do**. Every headless capture therefore lands unnamed, and a sessions
  list reads as a wall of untitled rows even though the messages arrived.
* **A renamed session keeps reporting its old name.** When the user renames
  a session the client writes a ``custom-title`` record — and goes on
  emitting the STALE ``ai-title`` beside it, on nearly every turn. Measured
  on a renamed session: 130 ``ai-title`` records all reading "Test updated
  brain MCP feature" interleaved with 47 ``custom-title`` records reading
  "better manifest and idex", with an ``ai-title`` frequently LAST. So
  "whichever came last" resolves to the name the user replaced.

Hence the two rules here. Precedence is by TYPE, never by position: an
explicit rename outranks a generated title no matter which record the client
wrote most recently. And when neither exists, the session's first real prompt
is better than nothing — a headless run is usually named by what it was asked
to do.

Stdlib only, no import-time side effects: ``flush_turn`` imports this inside a
Stop hook, where an import-time failure surfaces as a traceback in the user's
session.
