"""Cursor capture: hook-triggered flush of a cursor-agent session into MemHub.

The Cursor analog of ``flush_turn.py``, reusing its whole downstream —
``redact``, ``_memhub_auth.resolve_bearer``, ``brain_resolve``, ``room_map``,
``mcp_http`` — and differing in exactly the two places Cursor differs:

1. **Data source**: legacy Cursor/CLI sessions use the full-fidelity v1
   ``store.db``; current Cursor IDE sessions use the hook-provided JSONL under
   ``~/.cursor/projects``. Source choice is sticky per session so record UUIDs
   never shift if a second representation appears later.
2. **Watermark**: stores compare content-addressed blob ids; transcripts use a
   canonical-content digest. Exact completed-turn hook usage is persisted by
   generation id before the network call and folded into the final assistant
   record, so retries retain telemetry and duplicate ``afterAgentResponse`` /
   ``stop`` delivery never double-counts it. Per-record timestamps follow the
   same discipline: Cursor's artifacts carry real clocks for only some
   records, so each record is dated the moment a hook FIRST OBSERVES it and
   that pin is persisted before the network call (``_stamp_records``) — a
   re-send ships the original dates, never the re-send's wall clock.

The full canonical transcript is re-sent each flush under the constant
``conversation_id cursor-<uuid>``; the SERVER's watermark folds re-sends
forward (the same property Codex re-imports rely on). The local blob-id set
only decides WHETHER to flush, so a lost state file costs a redundant send,
never a lost or duplicated conversation.

Cursor IDE 3.17 emits ``afterAgentResponse`` and ``stop`` with exact usage;
Cursor Agent CLI 2026.08 emits only ``sessionStart`` / ``sessionEnd`` hooks and
keeps usage solely in caller-owned stream output. ``sessionEnd`` therefore
captures CLI content with nullable usage rather than estimating it.
``beforeShellExecution`` flushes only on milestone commands (git commit /
gh pr …) so ordinary shell traffic stays quiet. ``afterShellExecution``
captures the exact URL returned by a direct ``gh pr create`` because current
Cursor JSONL carries tool calls but not their results. ``afterFileEdit`` is
debounced. Whatever the trigger set misses, the next flush or an import-session
sweep heals — idempotence carries correctness, hooks carry latency.

Invoked by the portable Cursor launcher, which answers the hook's permission
contract immediately and re-runs this script detached - a slow server must
never hold up the user's shell command.

Runs under bare python3 (stdlib + sibling modules only — no mcp SDK), same
discipline as flush_turn.

    """Date every record with a REAL clock, pinned across re-sends.

    The server persists ``timestamp`` as the row's ``event_date`` — "the
    turn's clock at its source, NULL when unmeasured" (claude_parts,
    ENG-675b). Cursor's artifacts only carry clocks for SOME records (user
    turns' embedded tags, store checkpoint nodes), so this fills the gap with
    the one other real clock available: the moment THIS hook first observed
    the record. Once a session is under observation, any FLUSHING hook's
    sighting qualifies — the record provably exists at that instant, so
    first-seen bounds its production time from above by the gap since the
    previous event. (A debounced afterFileEdit — the one event that reads
    yet declines to send — skips minting so it never rewrites the pin map;
    the next flushing hook dates what it saw, a deferral bounded by the
    debounce interval. Guaranteed non-senders never read at all — see
    ``_event_can_flush``.) Boundary hooks (afterAgentResponse / stop /
    beforeSubmitPrompt) are the common observers, but a mid-turn edit hook
    that flushes and sees a record first dates it TIGHTER than waiting for
    the turn's end would — matching Claude transcripts, whose records carry
    per-record production times, not turn-boundary times. The session's FIRST-EVER observation is the one
    exception: its pre-existing backlog predates any hook by an unknowable
    margin, so those records are marked unmeasured rather than dated (the
    pinning rules below). What first-seen is never: the import/flush clock
    of a whole-session re-send, the degeneracy this replaces (a 44-turn
    production session dated at a single instant).

    Pinning: the first stamp a record ever gets — artifact-carried or
    first-seen — is stored in the session state and re-applied verbatim on
    every later re-send, so a record's date never drifts with the re-flush
    schedule. ``None`` pins mean "observed, no clock": records already present
    at the session's FIRST observation (a mid-session install, a backfill)
    predate any hook by an unknowable margin, so they stay unmeasured rather
    than inheriting "now" — except a ``boundary_uuids`` record, which the
    current hook explicitly dates (its generation just ended). A ``None`` pin
    upgrades if the artifact later supplies a real clock for that record; a
    MINTED pin is never displaced by one. That asymmetry is deliberate: a
    transcript record's embedded tag lives inside its content and exists
    from the record's birth (append-only files cannot grow one later — when
    both exist they are the same instant), while a store clock that APPEARS
    after a record was already observed live belongs to a NEWER checkpoint
    that re-parented the leaf — later than production, so the first-seen
    pin is the tighter bound. Displacement would also let one record ship
    different dates on the live path (pin) and the backstop re-read (reader
    clock) — exactly the flapping pinning exists to prevent.

    With ``now_iso=None`` this only APPLIES existing pins (read-only replay
    for out-of-band senders); no new stamps are minted. Mutates ``records``
    in place; returns the updated pin map for persisting.

    A pin whose record is still in ``records`` is NEVER evicted: transcripts
    are append-only, so early records are re-sent on every flush, and losing
    their pin would re-mint "now" for them — re-dating an early turn at a
    much-later wall clock (review finding on the original FIFO cap). Only
    pins ORPHANED by the artifact (a checkpoint restore shifting the
    index-derived uuids) are pruned, and only once the map outgrows
    ``_RECORD_TS_PRUNE_TRIGGER`` — which is a prune trigger, not a bound;
    the map deliberately scales with the live artifact (see the constant).
